### Another Update

After working on my Freedom Project for a while and brainstorming ideas, now is the time to choose a tool we will be using to assist us in creating a website to bring our ideas to life.

### What Tool?

The tool I chose to assist me on my website journey is called [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide/). I chose Sass because of its benefits and convenience, with Sass, I can replace lots of my CSS code with a predetermined code I gave a variable for. I had other great options such as Jekyll and Jquery but since at the moment I wanted to make my own website design, so I won't be using Jekyll, and I also won't be using Jquery because it's too complicated for me and I need some knowledge of Javascript which I don't have. So with that said, I started to tinker with Sass but was really unsuccessful.

### Problems

I didn't know how to start tinkering with Sass, so I brought this up to my teacher Mr.Mueller. And he guided me to Slack to join this channel to receive help. I asked for guidance in the Sass channel and received some from a senior. With their help, I was able to get started tinkering with Sass, meanwhile, I also went to research more sites to experiment with Sass and I found a website [here](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/166/sass). 

### Tinkering
In the website, I have tried adding on to what the website started with. Below you can see what it started out as. (CSS on the top left box, HTML on the bottom, and the result on the top right.

But after seeing how it works and understanding how the $ helped make everything easier, I decided to add a line myself to see what would happen, which you can see below.

(HTML on top, CSS on the bottom left, and the result on the right) As you can see, I have added `$font: 20px;
$back: #84C3BE;` on the CSS part to use for a new `<p>`. You can see on the bottom of the CSS `.p-text` includes all the available variables, which I will use. On the `<p>` side, I just added a new line with a new class to connect everything and you can see the results with the new rectangle that appears.

### Skills

I have used collaboration well becuase from the start, I'm new to Sass and needed help finding ways to tinker with it which I found when I asked for help. Without the collaboration of Mr.Mueller and Austin, I would have never found a way to tinker with Sass on my own.

### Sumup

I have received help from others which was really nice and useful for my progress which I am thankful for. I have tinkered with Sass and its functions which I appreciate and want to use when making my website.

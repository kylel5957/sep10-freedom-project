### Another Update

After working on my Freedom Project for a while and brainstorming ideas, now is the time to choose a tool we will be using to assist us in creating a website to bring our ideas to life.

### What Tool?

The tool I chose to assist me on my website journey is called [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide/). I chose Sass because of its benefits and convenience, with Sass, I can replace lots of my CSS code with a predetermined code I gave a variable for. So with this said, I started to tinker with Sass but was actually Unsuccessful

### Problems

I didn't know how to start tinkering with Sass, so I brought this up to my teacher Mr.Mueller. And he guided me to slack to join this channel to recive help. In the channel, I asked for guidence and I recived some from a senior. With their help, I was able to get started to tinker

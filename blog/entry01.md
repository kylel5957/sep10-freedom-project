### Why Chess?
I chose Chess as my topic for the year-long project because of my interest in chess. I have always loved playing chess ever since I was a kid and that's why it's one of my favorite hobbies. With chess as my topic, I had to research how technology has affected chess and some articles I found were ["A Journey through Chess-playing Machines"](https://blog.amphy.com/chess-and-technology/#:~:text=From%20early%20chess%2Dplaying%20machines,the%20study%20of%20complex%20endgames.) and ["AI and Its Impact on Chess"](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/ai-and-its-impact-on-chess-78e4ceb95c21) both talking about how new technology has changed the way everyone play chess professionally and casually. Other articles such as ["The Ultimate Checkmate: AI and Chess Engines"](https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/ai-ml/the-ultimate-checkmate-ai-and-chess-engines/#:~:text=In%20chess%2C%20artificial%20intelligence%20and,decisions%20based%20on%20its%20analysis.) talk in-depth about how certain chess bots were made, learns, and get better which is fascinating. Lastly, I found an article called [What Chess Computers Can Show Us About The Future Of Humans And Technology In Manufacturing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/03/16/what-chess-computers-can-show-us-about-the-future-of-humans-and-technology-in-manufacturing/?sh=171ff0ae7e6b)that talks about how if technology improves in the chess world, it can also improve other sectors. 

### EDP
I'm  in the first and second stages of the engineering design process (EDP) at the moment. The first goal is to define the problem, and the second is to research solutions. The problem I hope to solve is informing people about just how much technology has influenced chess and how that was shocking. The next stage is to research the problem, so I will be researching on the topic to educate myself before educating others.

### Why Chess?
I chose Chess as my topic for the year-long project because of my interest in chess. I have always loved playing chess ever since I was a kid and that's why it's one of my favorite hobbies. With chess as my topic, I had to research how technology has affected chess and some articles I found were ["A Journey through Chess-playing Machines"](https://blog.amphy.com/chess-and-technology/#:~:text=From%20early%20chess%2Dplaying%20machines,the%20study%20of%20complex%20endgames.) and ["AI and Its Impact on Chess"](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/ai-and-its-impact-on-chess-78e4ceb95c21) both talking about how new technology has changed the way everyone play chess professionally and casually. Other articles such as ["The Ultimate Checkmate: AI and Chess Engines"](https://www.codemotion.com/magazine/ai-ml/the-ultimate-checkmate-ai-and-chess-engines/#:~:text=In%20chess%2C%20artificial%20intelligence%20and,decisions%20based%20on%20its%20analysis.) talk in-depth about how certain chess bots were made, learns, and get better which is fascinating. Lastly, I found an article called [What Chess Computers Can Show Us About The Future Of Humans And Technology In Manufacturing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/03/16/what-chess-computers-can-show-us-about-the-future-of-humans-and-technology-in-manufacturing/?sh=171ff0ae7e6b)that talks about how if technology improves in the chess world, it can also improve other sectors. 

### EDP
I'm  in the first stage of the engineering design process (EDP) at the moment, and the first goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve is to inform people about just how influential technology was to chess and how that . The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation.

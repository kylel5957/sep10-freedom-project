### Why Chess?
I chose Chess as my topic for the year-long project because of my interest in chess. I have loved playing chess since I was a kid and that's why it's one of my favorite hobbies. With chess as my topic, I had to research how technology has affected chess and some articles I found were ["A Journey through Chess-playing Machines"](https://blog.amphy.com/chess-and-technology/#:~:text=From%20early%20chess%2Dplaying%20machines,the%20study%20of%20complex%20endgames.) and [AI and Its Impact on Chess](https://medium.com/illumination-curated/ai-and-its-impact-on-chess-78e4ceb95c21) both talking about how new technology has changed the way everyone play chess.

### Progress Report

After completing blog entry #2, I have progressed in my research and understanding of the state technology affected chess. I have featured a new invention that I wasn't aware of but discovered after further research. The new and fascinating tech I discovered was ["Square Off"](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS-NY3RtKijQX4Qt_kT1pPPUUjQs72ULN0L2A&usqp=CAU). Square off is an invention where it utilizes magnets to move all the pieces to where they belong. Along with that, with the help of suggestions made to my list of ideas, an idea was raised. What if AI could give hints in chess puzzles without revealing the answer of the puzzle while still making the user to think about the right move. This was a great idea and definately is feasible with some coding.

### Research

Finishing my blog entry #2, I did a bit more researching about the history of chess. I learnt a lot about the history of chess, its original names, what is was based off of, and how long it was around for. I compiled all of my research in [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZuaRyhUZd8yxD-rJMp6xuo9VW-2XNPqi3ibNfIiUlM/edit)  

### Present technology 
 * Square Off (Auto reset pieces)
 * Chess notation devices (Instead of writing moves you move the pieces and the device notates for you)
 * AI Chess Board (you can practice against AI)
 * DGT Boards (Relays moves from the board to a screen) 

### Future technology
 * Better and Stronger computers that can completely solve games?
 * Boards that always can reset themsevles quickly and doesn't cost a lot
 * Chess notation, in the future the board can print out a notation sheet after the game for the players to take

### Engineering Design Process (EDP)
 
In the engineering design process, I am currently on step 4, after finishing step 3 which was brainstorming possible solutions. Step 4 requires you to plan the most promising solution which I intend to do after figuring out the neccessary requirements to make the solution happen. I have an idea of what the invention would [look](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZuaRyhUZd8yxD-rJMp6xuo9VW-2XNPqi3ibNfIiUlM/edit) like.

### Skills

#### Creativity

While making an idea of possible inventions in the future of chess, I had to think outside the box, and so I thought about what happens during the game and afterwards. I thought of an idea that in the future, chess boards would come with mini printers made to print out a notation sheet so that in the future so that we would not have to write down the moves. This idea came about because I had put together my past experiences playing in tournaments and what I wish could have been different technologically.

#### Growth mindset

During the research part of the assignment, I was stumped for ideas, I didn't know what could be improved on technologically in chess and so I took some advice I got. A suggestion was having an app that helps a player remember their notations. I thought about that idea and adjusted it, how about instead of an app, we directly gave the player the notation sheet right after they finished their game. Along with that, I also went to a chess tournament during the weekends to also get some inspiration. With that personal experience and with the suggestion I recieved, I thought of the idea where chess boards would print out a notation sheet right after the game was done.

### Summary 

Chess has been a blast to research as I learned a lot of new things I never knew before. This has given me new information that I want to share with others. Once I set up my website, I definately want to share this information with others who are curious.

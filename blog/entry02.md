### An Update
Since writing blog 1, I have discovered new hardware and software for my topic, chess. During my research, I found many interesting websites such as [Chess 24](https://chess24.com/en), [WTHarvey](https://www.wtharvey.com/), and [Listudy](https://listudy.org/en). These websites are all unique themselves as they have different characteristics, Chess 24 has very educational content to level up your skill in chess, WTHarvey has endless tactics for you to solve to practice looking ahead and thinking about what happens next, and Listudy gives you blogs to read about the chess world as well as tutorials to help you memorize openings. 

### Hardware 
After researching about the software the chess world uses, I found some hardware. Some cool hardware that is used in chess are Chess clocks, notation phones, custom chess pieces, chess books, and even custom chess boards that can even be powered by AI. The hardware in chess is fascinating as there are impressive technologies that an average chess player can get for themselves. [A Notation phone](https://i0.wp.com/www.campfirechess.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-20-2.jpg?resize=629%2C359) is a great example, they are used if a player doesn't want to write out their notations but still have the notation for the game afterward. Another impressive technology that has been implemented into chess is the [AI chessboard](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7rt5yMjxXhcD6DXJSkQQlO7Zc6XJBwfilNLz-UVUJkdH1X1npHZrq0QDCTcjgZ-qVeBI&usqp=CAU). It's fascinating to play against an AI which you cannot even see. This hardware can help improve players' skill level as they can practice against the AI for long periods, unlike a human which has things to do. 

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
At the moment in my EDP I'm between steps 2 and 3. Step 2 is about researching the problem, which I can always do and improve on. Step 3 requires you to brainstorm possible solutions, and I can make a website that documents the information I find for others to see and learn about. At this time, I can even look at step 4 which is planning the most promising solution. Recently I've done projects that require you to code and build a website from scratch, an example would be my [collaboration work](https://computer-virus.kylel119.repl.co/).

### Skills 
#### How to Google
While researching my topic, I picked up the skill of how to properly do a Google search. Before I picked up on some tips, I would have just googled a generic sentence to try to find what I was looking for, but now I have noticed that searching in a certain way is more beneficial for me in finding the information needed. I learned that using quotation marks will filter out all the unrelated topics and only keep the ones that have the keywords you put in quotations. I also learned that you can set anytime time-specific articles and documents so that they're more tailored to your needs. These tips greatly helped me find my websites, an example would be finding the article ["What Chess Computers Can Show Us About The Future Of Humans And Technology In Manufacturing"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/03/16/what-chess-computers-can-show-us-about-the-future-of-humans-and-technology-in-manufacturing/?sh=6ab1ae277e6b). If you only typed in "how does the advancement of chess influence society", it won't bring up the article, but once you add quotations "future of humans" after it, the article will popup.

#### How to Read
While looking through articles, I realized that it would be too time-consuming if I looked through each article one by one, but if I read the title and looked for keywords as well as looking at the description of the website, that can help me find the right article. Once I found the right article, I still would skim through the article if it's too long, as usually, you want to look for the key points of the article that strongly support what you are looking for. I use this skill so that I can note down what each article is about which I can always look back upon while going on looking for other articles that also support my end goal.

### Summary
My topic is really interesting and I have learned quite a bit about some technology that is used behind the scenes I can't wait to inform others of my findings about my topic.

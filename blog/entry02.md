### An Update
Since writing blog 1, I have discovered new hardware and software for my topic, chess. During my research, I found many interesting websites such as [Chess 24](https://chess24.com/en), [WTHarvey](https://www.wtharvey.com/), and [Listudy](https://listudy.org/en). These websites are all unique to themselves as they have different characteristics, Chess 24 has very educational content to level up your skill in chess, WTHarvey has endless tactic for you to solve to practice looking ahead and thinking about what happens next, and Listudy gives you blogs to read about the chess world as well as tutorials to help you memorize openings.

### An Update
Since writing blog 1, I have discovered new hardware and software for my topic, chess. During my research, I found many interesting websites such as [Chess 24](https://chess24.com/en), [WTHarvey](https://www.wtharvey.com/), and [Listudy](https://listudy.org/en). These websites are all unique themselves as they have different characteristics, Chess 24 has very educational content to level up your skill in chess, WTHarvey has endless tactics for you to solve to practice looking ahead and thinking about what happens next, and Listudy gives you blogs to read about the chess world as well as tutorials to help you memorize openings. 

### EDP (Engineering Design Process)
At the moment in my EDP I'm between steps 2 and 3. Step 2 is about researching the problem, which I can always do and improve on. Step 3 requires you to brainstorm possible solutions, and I can make a website that documents the information I find for others to see and learn about. At this time, I can even look at step 4 which is planning the most promising solution. Recently I've done projects that require you to code and build a website from scratch and an example would be my [collaboration work](https://computer-virus.kylel119.repl.co/)

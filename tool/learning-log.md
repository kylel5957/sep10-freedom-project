# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **SASS**

---

2/26/24:
* Today I tried getting SASS onto my github but nothing works so ima ask for help, instead just practiced on other websites using SASS to make different stuff like borders and using variables to change colors
  * https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/166/sass

3/1/24:
* Today I watched a bunch of youtube videos to get sass running in my ide, following their instruction but it wasn't going great
 *  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J__JAgQbS0
 *  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nu5mdN2JIwM
Just some of videos I watched to try to solve my problem

3/2/24:
* I tried getting SASS into my IDE and was still unsuccessful untill I asked Austin for help, his guidence helped me get SASS working inside my IDE. Now I can write in SASS and it will be automatically converted into CSS but now I still need to link the CSS file to my HTML which is suppose to be easy but isn't working even with help.


3/3/24:
* Finally got everythigng working and connected (turns out the problem was a typo which I fixed after looking through my entire code), any Scss I write will be automatically converted into CSS if I turn on watch sass. Next time maybe I can try to add another tool in alongside SASS to see if it will work

3/6/24:
* Learning about nesting and how it differs from the CSS version
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGJDLINQx2Q

3/10/24:
* Tried nesting and did experiments with it
* Nested 2 different articles but inside they have different classes and was successful
* Looking at future possible features to try- mixins, seems like variables but you can write a whole few lines of code instead of just for 1 variable

3/14/24:
* Started to try out Mixins
* Looks a bit confusing with the new commands it uses and the format
* Had a problem with my chrombook that I could use and function keys and I needed it to start watching for my sass
* My solution was to go to settings and go to keyboard shortcuts and give watch sass a keyboard shortcut which worked

3/15/24
* Picked off where I left off and started by trying out what ive seen on the official website
* https://sass-lang.com/guide/
* Mixins are exactly what I thought it was, basically a bunch of variables stuck together so that if you use one mixin command, you use all of the variables.
* Based on the examples, I see how it is being used, by using `@mixin theme($theme:color) {}` and adding varables inside the brackets, you can set the mixin in up.
* After finishing putting the variables, you can use those variables by typing `@include theme;` inside a class or id, and just like that, you can use the predetermined set of variables.

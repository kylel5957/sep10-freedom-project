* I tried getting SASS into my IDE and was still unsuccessful untill I asked Austin for help, his guidence helped me get SASS working inside my IDE. Now I can write in SASS and it will be automatically converted into CSS but now I still need to link the CSS file to my HTML which is suppose to be easy but isn't working even with help.
